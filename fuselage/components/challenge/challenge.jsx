                <p>
                    Throughout its history as a resting spot for pilgrims, a family home and a profitable vineyard, Château de Sours has always been closely tied to the land. In 2016, the estate, vineyard and surrounding land located in the Entre-Deux-Mers region of France were revived by Alibaba founder Jack Ma with a new vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For its latest incarnation, Château de Sours was reborn around the philosophy of permaculture and environmental responsibility – breaking from tradition to innovate the art of winemaking and land management. He wanted to set a new benchmark for other progressive vineyards to reimagine the way they manage their vineyards.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Château de Sours team approached Base Creative to create a website that would reflect this innovative vision to global connoisseurs.
